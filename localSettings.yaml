# default file extension of backup file (if -w switch is active)

#       myfile.tex

# backup file will be
#       myfileBACKUP.bak
backupExtension: .bak

# only one backup per file:
#   - if onlyOneBackUp is 0 then, as a safety measure,
#     the number on the extension increments by 1 each time:
#
#           myfile.bak0, myfile.bak1, myfile.bak2
#   - if you set onlyOnebackUp to 1, then the backup file will
#     be overwritten each time (not recommended until you trust the script)

# some users may want a finite number of backup files,
